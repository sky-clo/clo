# Sky/Clo Frontend

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app). Please refer to their documentation before running this application for a basic understanding of what create-react-app does and what configuration files it handles for you behind the scenes.

## Component Documentation

This project is built using the Sky CSS Toolkit via SCSS imports. You can find all the relevant documentation for Sky related assets/components at [Sky Toolkit's Website](https://www.sky.com/toolkit) (https://www.sky.com/toolkit).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm install`

This builds the dependencies for the project, this is needed if you are running the react project for the first time or if changes have been made to the dependencies folder. 

Note the node_modules folder is purposefully left ignored on git to avoid a bloated git repo, so please don't commit this folder or the files within.

#### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br />
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits (hot-reloading).<br />
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

#### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.<br />
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

#### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br />
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br />
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.
