# behave

## Documentation

behave is a BDD testing framework (similar to Cucumber) that uses Python. This means that you can use Gherkin to outline your test scenarios, but also benefit from Python's simple syntax when using Selenium, for instance.

The documentation can be found [here](https://behave.readthedocs.io/en/latest/).

## Directory Structure

Gherkin .feature files are placed in the 'features' folder, and corresponding Python script files are placed in the 'steps' folder. Basic examples are shown in the 'tutorial.feature' and 'tutorial.py' files. A tutorial on behave can be found [here](https://behave.readthedocs.io/en/latest/tutorial.html), and the syntax reference guide for Gherkin can be found [here](https://cucumber.io/docs/gherkin/reference/).
