# behave

## Documentation

behave is a BDD testing framework (similar to Cucumber), except it uses Python. This means you can make use of Gherkin for writing your test scenarios, but also benefit from Python's simple syntax when writing Selenium tests, for instance.

The documentation can be found [here](https://behave.readthedocs.io/en/latest/).
