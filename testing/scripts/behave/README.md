# behave

## Documentation

behave is a BDD testing framework (similar to Cucumber) that uses Python. This means that you can use Gherkin to outline your test scenarios, but also benefit from Python's simple syntax when using Selenium, for instance.

The documentation can be found [here](https://behave.readthedocs.io/en/latest/).
