# Cucumber and Gherkin

## Documentation

### Cucumber

Cucumber is a software testing tool for BDD that takes feature documentation written in plain english and uses it to execute automated tests. The documentation can be found [here](https://cucumber.io/docs/cucumber/).

### Gherkin

Gherkin is a syntax which puts plain english into a structure that can be understood by Cucumber. It's both human-readable and interpretable by a computer, so it can be useful when specifying requirements, structuring and running automated tests, and documenting how the product behaves. The Gherkin reference can be found [here](https://cucumber.io/docs/gherkin/).

## Example

### Rome2Rio

[Here](..../testing/scripts/Cucumber/rome2RioCucumberExample) is an example of a basic Cucumber project, which mimics the Selenium test on Rome2Rio shown [here](..../testing/scripts/Selenium/rome2RioExample.py). In the Cucumber example, the test scenario is laid out in a Gherkin feature file, which is then used to structure the automated test.
